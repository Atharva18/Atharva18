      <p>
      <br>
I've always found mathematics and problem-solving fascinating. Computer gaming and the intense passion that accompanied it were the beginning of everything. With time, I came to understand that video games were simply apps that could be created, and I could do it myself! During my education, I developed an interest in the technical aspects of computers, the internet, and all the apps that may be created and how they simplify human life.

And now, I am a software developer with a passion for backend development. I love designing and developing scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available software applications.

I have a work experience of 3 years as a Software Developer at SAP Labs India. Iâ€™m hands-on in all stages of the software development cycle, from planning and design to testing and deployment. I have worked in the Data Privacy Domain and have an acquaintance with how GDPR rules and regulations are implemented in software applications.

I have strong knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms and possess good problem-solving skills.<br>
